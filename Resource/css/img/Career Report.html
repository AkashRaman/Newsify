        <h1>Orientation</h1>

        <p>A person’s Orientation skills define his basic attitude towards a situation, decision, event, task, interaction with people, what drives him, which influences his working style highly. So in this part of the assessment we assess a person’s orientation skills based on four main categories: Management, Informative, Creative and People.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, consider if you are running an Organisation which design, manufacture and sell footwear like Nike or Adidas, you need all these four sets of people:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>People with <strong>Administrative skills</strong> can manage targets and deadlines, manage projects and tasks, manage people and teams,&nbsp; manage finance and accounts etc&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>People with <strong>Creative skills</strong> can design footwear with world class style and create top trending designs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>People with <strong>Informative skills</strong> can effectively access or research the information available and adopt new methods to manufacture futuristic footwears using technology.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>People with <strong>People skills</strong> can provide solutions for the problems and needs of the people. This is because they have the ability to mingle well, make deep casual interactions with the people around.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In order to run an organisation all these sets of people should work together in which you must find your core area of strength and this assessment will help you to find out your Dominant orientation skills.</strong></p>

        <h2>Area of Improvement:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Arrogant and impatient&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Impatience is understandable given this fast technological world, almost every human expects instant answers. But being rude to people is something that might be habituated to, well the good thing is both can be corrected with the conscious thought process and focused change of habit.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>
	<p><strong>Manipulative&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Are you that person who talks to people in a way to get your work done through them? In leadership that’s a great skill, good that you already can make others listen to you. But using this in personal life by manipulating people around you for your good fetches poor impression. People have great skills which might also be useful to you, try to explore it.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p><strong>Stubborn&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s good to be stubborn at times. This quality can sometimes help you showcase your strengths and capabilities. But if that’s being an obstacle for your growth, then you gotta make some adjustments for the sake of reaching your goal. Did you know? Being adaptable is the best quality most successful people have.</p>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p><strong>Bored quickly and easily</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;Do you get easily bored? yes? This character of yours needs exciting or intriguing ideas to keep you engaged, and this ability of yours would make you be an inventor or Marketing strategist and also be successful at it. But until then, hold tight and keep yourself engaged by learning new skills. This will take you to great heights in the long-run.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="5">
	<li>
	<p><strong>Private&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Privacy is good but in this technological world, to be honest there is no privacy. Yet looking forward to spending more alone time and not opening up would help you to keep away from fake people but in this process, you might lose a few valuable people whom you cherish for life. Loosen up a bit and socialize, you would like it.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="6">
	<li>
	<p><strong>Avoid long term commitments</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Being in the present is one of the most common preachable good behaviors by motivational speakers, and this doesn’t mean you must not plan or commit to accomplish goals. Without a plan for the future, you would feel lost pretty soon when your friends are accomplishing in life. Commitment is a very powerful and rewarding action, all strong people can do it. If you are one of them, go on and commit to your work and future for a fruitful tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

Our civilization would be as advanced as the Stone Age without these people. This career demands a wide knowledge of subjects such as science, English, and a strong foundation of mathematics. Engineering also requires imagination because the engineer will have to invent objects used for everyday life or improve existing objects to upgrade the environment for people. Day to day work on any field in engineering will be about solving problems using technical and practical skills, maths, science, research, prototypes, design, manufacturing, production and maintenance. Strong communication skill, technical expertise in a subject will make you shine in your career on a long run. The field’s advantages include interesting, creative work and working with the latest technological advances in the field you choose to go into. As an engineer, your workplace can be anywhere. Maybe in an office, in a factory, on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean, in a laboratory, or even in outer space. Once you set yourself in the right place, Engineers are very secure with respect to material compensation.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Mathematicians and statisticians are always in demand. They find concealed relationships and patterns and invent the detailed predictive models useful in almost every industry. On one hand, if you become a mathematician or a statistician, you will be researching, analysing, developing and utilizing mathematical or statistical theories and algorithms for academic purposes. Alternatively, you could be solving practical problems by applying maths on real-life situations.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The ability of advanced mathematics and high-level statistical analysis can help financial organizations to improve their position in the market, support engineering companies in solving complex technical problems and help medical research organisations to implement new treatments and develop the functionality of medical equipment. It can also be used to derive business strategies and industrial processes. To have a career in this sector, you will need a degree in a corresponding subject, mathematics. Most of the mathematicians and statisticians will actually own a PhD or MSc. Mathematics and statistics pave the way for a huge variety of rewarding and well-compensating careers. Career pathways include roles such as actuary, data scientist, statistician, ecological modeller, computer programmer, share-broker, communication, and signals analyst and many more. So, if you are a bit of a ‘math machine’ and your integers are looking good, the odds are that you would be well suited to a career in mathematical and statistical sciences.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Architecture, the chief creation is what it means in Greek. It is a field that dates back to the beginning of civilization. The beautifully laid out cities of Mesopotamia, the gigantic Egyptian pyramids, the unique underground drainage system of Indus valley civilization are the evidence for their superiority. Likewise, now everything that is built will have a mastermind architect and a planner behind it applying all the senses considering various requirements and constraints to bring up an efficient and sophisticated output. Architecture jobs in the sector of urban city planning are in high demand. This is due to the rising interest that more and more cities show in ''green'' planning, renewal of urban spaces, and increased efficiency of their existing spaces.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:24px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In order to find yourself in architecture engineering jobs in an urban setting, you should have an educational background in architectural engineering. This can include a Masters or Bachelor’s degree in architecture or a similar field. Experience in engineering and the use of programs like AutoCAD, 3DModeling, or other visualization software coupled with proficiency in Revit, Sketchup, 3D Studio, or Photoshop is generally favouring these days.</span></span></p>
